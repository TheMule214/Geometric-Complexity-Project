# 🌌 Geometric Complexity Project: A Topological Approach to P vs NP

> **Disclaimer:** I am a system architect, not a professional mathematician. This project does **NOT** claim to have a formal mathematical proof for P vs NP. Instead, it proposes a radically new conceptual bridge: translating discrete computational complexity into continuous topological resistance. 

## 🧠 The Core Hypothesis
For decades, theoretical computer science has analyzed algorithms as discrete Turing machines. We propose shifting the paradigm to **Physics and Differential Geometry**. What if computational complexity is fundamentally a geometric bottleneck?

We introduce a framework that maps Boolean logic into 3D manifolds and subjects them to geometric flows:
1. **The Mapping:** A 3-SAT instance is encoded into an **Artin Braid Group**. Through Markov closure and Dehn surgery, we construct a closed 3D manifold $M_{\Phi}$.
2. **The Flow:** We subject this manifold to a **Chern-Simons modified Ricci Flow** (inspired by Perelman's work on the Poincaré conjecture).
3. **The Singularity:** 
   - If the 3-SAT is **Satisfiable**, the flow smoothly unfolds the manifold into a constant curvature state in Polynomial Time.
   - If **Unsatisfiable**, topological dead-knots ("incompressible tori") force the geometric flow to bottleneck, producing a **Curvature Singularity** in finite time.

## 🤝 The Open-Source Challenge (Call for Collaborators)
My contribution is the architectural mapping (Logic to Topology). But calculating the exact PDE boundary conditions and running the simulations require specialized skills. I am open-sourcing this idea to find "Wizards" in the following domains:

*   **🧙‍♂️ Differential Geometers / Topologists:** To rigorously verify the mapping boundaries from Braid words to 3D Manifolds.
*   **💻 Computational Physicists / PDE Hackers:** To write a Ricci flow numerical solver.
*   **⚡ Supercomputing Clusters:** Someone with the GPU/Cluster power to render a 10-variable 3-SAT formula physically collapsing into a singularity on screen.

### Let's build a visualizer. 
Seeing a computational formula physically collapse into a geometric singularity will change how we understand computer science forever.
